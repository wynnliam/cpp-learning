/*
	If you know me in real life, you know I loooove functional stuff. So when
	I learned about lambdas, I was really exicted to dive into them. It took me
	awhile, but I finally get to explore them here!

	Tutorial I'm using comes from here:
	https://blog.feabhas.com/2014/03/demystifying-c-lambdas/

	Lambda's are basically ad-hoc locally scoped function objects. As I understand it,
	they are function objects done with sugar syntax.

	Please, do read the link above. One thing I will not cover here is what
	happens under the hood. Basically, a lambda becomes a function object
	at compile time. The client code is updated to use this.

void demo_04_context_capture() {
	/*
		What makes function objects so neat? Not only do
		you overload the function call operator, but you can
		supply additional parameters via class/struct members.

		This makes it much easier to handle say special cases
		for printing a list. Do you want to print only certain items?
		You can do that by specifying members for the function object.

		How about a lambda? In the above scenario, we returned the
		first point whose x coordinate was 4, but we hard-coded that.
		It would be nice to be able to parameterize that some how.

		In this demo, we do so with "context-capturing". Context-capturing
		enables us to access variables outside of the lambda. This isn't
		just passing an argument. Consider in this demo. We use the
		for_each algorithm. If we supplied an additional argument, we
		would not be able to use it in for_each.

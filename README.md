# cpp-learning
A repository of various demos for learning modern C++.

This is a collection of code samples that demonstrate modern C++ features.
This includes classics like the Standard Template Library, Vectors, but hopefully
recent stuff like new parallelism functionality and what not.

It is my hope that I can revamp my knowledge and love for C++ (and its predecessor C).

## How to run the examples?
Navigate to any example you want. For most cases, you need only

```
g++ -g -Wall file-name.cpp
```

The `-g` and `-Wall` are not needed, but I compile like this almost all the time.
If this is insufficient, then look at the source code file itself, that should
provide specific instructions.
